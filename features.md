# StreamWall v2 Features Roadmap

## Phase 1: Advanced Tab - Drag and Drop Implementation

### Grid System Enhancement
- [ ] Drag and drop functionality for stream repositioning
- [ ] Collision detection to prevent overlapping
- [ ] Responsive grid that adapts to screen size
- [ ] Grid cell highlighting during drag operations
- [ ] Grid snap-to guidelines
- [ ] Maximum grid size enforcement (16 spaces)
- [ ] Minimum cell size restrictions
- [ ] Grid resize handles on corners and edges

### Button Controls
- [x] Remove stream button with trash can icon
- [x] Basic/Advanced mode toggle buttons:
    - [x] Basic button: Auto-arrange streams to fill grid efficiently
    - [x] Advanced button: Show stream list with Live/Offline/Custom categories
- [x] Button tooltips:
    - [x] Grid control tooltips (open window, devtools, rotate, remove)
    - [x] Stream control tooltips (listening, blur, reload, swap)
    - [x] Stream management tooltips (add, delete, start/stop)
    - [x] Team management tooltips (invite, revoke)

### Stream Management
- [ ] Visual drag indicators and drop zone highlights
- [ ] Stream position swapping capability
- [ ] Resize handles on stream containers
- [ ] Aspect ratio maintenance during resizing
- [ ] Stream preview during drag operations
- [ ] Stream z-index management
- [ ] Stream focus/active state handling
- [ ] Stream position memory within session
- [ ] Drag and drop from stream list to grid
- [ ] Visual feedback during stream movement

## Phase 2: Basic Tab - Automatic Layout System

### Layout Algorithm
Automatic stream arrangement based on count:
- [ ] 1 stream: Full width/height layout
- [ ] 2 streams: 1x2 grid layout
- [ ] 3 streams: 2+1 arrangement (2 on top, 1 bottom full width)
- [ ] 4 streams: 2x2 grid layout
- [ ] 5 streams: 2x2 + 1 bottom layout
- [ ] 6 streams: 3x2 grid layout
- [ ] 7 streams: 3x2 + 1 bottom layout
- [ ] 8 streams: 4x2 grid layout
- [ ] 9 streams: 3x3 grid layout
- [ ] 10 streams: 3x3 + 1 bottom layout
- [ ] 11 streams: 3x3 + 2 bottom layout
- [ ] 12 streams: 4x3 grid layout
- [ ] 13 streams: 4x3 + 1 bottom layout
- [ ] 14 streams: 4x3 + 2 bottom layout
- [ ] 15 streams: 4x3 + 3 bottom layout
- [ ] 16 streams: 4x4 grid layout

### Responsive Design
- [ ] Responsive containers adapting to screen size
- [ ] Automatic video stream scaling
- [ ] Aspect ratio maintenance across screen sizes
- [ ] Instant position adjustment when adding/removing streams
- [ ] Dynamic grid gap adjustment
- [ ] Minimum stream size enforcement
- [ ] Mobile device support and optimization
- [ ] Breakpoint-based layout adjustments
- [ ] Touch device interaction support
- [ ] Screen rotation handling

## Phase 3: Stream Controls Enhancement

### UI Components
- [ ] New remove button with icon for each stream
